ray-mmd by Rui (github.com/ray-cast)

How to use: Just drop the contents from the zip file to your Materials/Hair folder and it should work.

Rules: There are none, really. Edit all you want. 
I am not sure if Rui has any restrictions about the use of ray-mmd, but if there are those would apply to this 
material edit too.

Credits: I got the normalmaps from a VanillaBear3600 2017 hair material edit (link below), but it isn't compatible 
with newer ray-mmd versions. In VanillaBear's package the normalmaps are credited to RGL. So credits to RGL, I 
guess.
